# Rust-SDL2 Starter Boilerplate
Rust SDL2 Starter Project (specifically setup for development on Windows)
Setup with a build script & dlls/libs for quick and easy startup, as described in the Rust-SDL2 readme.

I made this project for a quicker boilerplate to quickly get setup with Rust-SDL2 which can be frustrating to setup from scratch on Windows.

Comes With:
SDL2
SDL2_Image

Additional SDL2 libraries can be added by downloading the relevant packages and placing their DLLs and LIB files in their respective folder 
(For more information read the Rust-SDL2 Readme)
